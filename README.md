## Working with the repository

develop - the main development branch containing the latest working version of the project.\
For each task, we create a new branch from develop, make changes, create a pull request in develop.\
Branches created at the beginning of work on new functionality should be based on the current state of the develop branch.\
All merges into the develop branch are made only through Pull Requests.\
A branch is considered merge-ready in develop if there is at least one confirmation from another team member or mentor,
and all comments (if any) are marked as completed.\
A comment can only be marked as completed by the person who left it..

## Sending for evaluation

At the end of each sprint we make a pull request from the develop branch to the main branch with a description in accordance with the requirements of rs-school. 🎓\
The link to pull request is for mentor.\
The link to deployment is for cross-check submit.
